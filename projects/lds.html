        <p>
          In this project I obtain Lithuanian government data, using their
          <a
            href="https://osp.stat.gov.lt/rdb-rest"
            class="text-blue-800 underline"
            >Official Statistics Portal RESTful web service</a
          >
          (OSP SDMX 2.1 RESTful web service).

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Motivation</h2>
        <p class="w-2/3">
          There are two major problems, that are connected with the data, which
          I will try to disect. First(some-what chronologically) is climate
          change. It is a major, human caused, issue, that may have catastrophic
          consequences. A way to combat(or mitigate) this issue is using less
          energy resources, which contribute to the rising percentage of
          green-house gasses in the atmosphere. The data, which have taken from
          OSP(Official Statistics Portal) will allow me to acess, how well
          Lithuania has been trying to combat the climate change. 
        </p>
          
        <p class="w-2/3 mt-5">
          Second issue is war in Ukraine. It is argued, that a major factor, that allowed the
          war to happen and that mitigated the abillity to saction Russia, is
          Europe's imports of Russian gas. It allowed Russia to build up a "war
          chest" to both finance the war and survive sanctions. So I will look
          into how well, how fast did Lithuania moved from Russian gas, and what
          alternatives were used. Also, it would be great to have a forecasting
          model.
        </p>
          
        <p class="w-2/3 mt-5">
        Third issue is the effect this has on the economy. Any negative
          results on the economy this has can limit the willingness of policy
          makers to make these changes. So the effects should be analised, and
          compared to other countries.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">Data collection</h2>
        <p class="w-2/3">
          As mentioned earlier, I used the OSP RESTful web service to get their
          . Because, I wanted to test my R programming skills, I decided, to
          access the API programmaticaly, using R
          <span class="font-mono text-sm">requests</span> and
          <span class="font-mono text-sm">XML</span> libraries. Also, getting
          data programatically, allows automatically updating, if you use a
          scheduler and store the data in some kind of database or
          datawarehouse.
        </p>

        <p class="w-2/3 mt-5">
          The first problem was getting the codes for the indicators, that I
          wanted to get. I wasn't able to find them in the data portal, so I
          decided to scrape them programmatically with R. For this I only needed
          to write a couple of functions and pass a list of dataset names
          through the function.
        </p>

        <p class="w-2/3 mt-5">
          After that, the next challenge was scraping the XML files provided by
          the OSP API. For a single dataset I needed to make two calls to the
          API: one for raw data, and another for the codes, since dimensions are
          encoded. After translating the dimension codes, the final dataset is
          cached.

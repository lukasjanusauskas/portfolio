      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">NLP empowered Recommender system</h1>

      <h2 class="text-2xl">An effective recommender system is vital for any company, that specializes in eCommerce or online streaming.
        A good recommendation system can increase sales and total time spent on a site.
        Here I will show you, how I made a recommender system using only open data and Python.
      </h2>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-5" id="duom">Data</h2>
      <p class="">
        For this project I used Amazon book reviews dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews"><b>kaggle</b></a>. 
        The semi-raw data, that I worked with is represented by an ERD diagram in the dataset page. After cleaning I ended up with this: 

        <div class="flex flex-row mt-10">
          <div class="lg:w-1/2 w-full h-fit md:ml-5"><iframe allowfullscreen class="w-full h-96" frameborder="0" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/1c78af9f-8c9b-4112-8b97-e0d5a0254a14" id="x6kqeUOH.0p_"></iframe></div>
          <p class="w-1/3 ml-20" class="mt-10 ml-5">
            Firstly, I ommited unnecessary columns and factorized(for example, instead of putting the name of the category into the table, I used a number from the category list to save space)
            text columns such as the <i>category</i> or <i>publisher</i> columns.
            Then I cleaned descriptions, that were to long. Long descriptions would have hurt both model training time and recommendation time. 
            Furthermore, such descriptions might have been generated by bots or other bad actors. 
            Now for the fun part. I used PCA to, essentialy, represent descriptions as a list of five numbers(a 5D vector).
            For mathematical specifics and better conceptual understanding refer to:

    <h2 class="xl:text-xl italic pt-10">Now that we have our data in proper format, we can start analyzing and creating a model.</h2>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-3">Exploratory analysis</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><b>The distribution of reviews</b></li>

        The most important EDA task, when creating a recommender system is assessing the rating distribution.

        <div class="flex flex-row">
          <iframe class="w-1/2 h-96" src="./bar1.html"></iframe>
          <p class="ml-5 w-1/3 mt-2 content-center text-xl italic">The overwhelming majority of reviews are positive. <b> This is a problem. </b> Because of this uneven distribution,
          recommender model will make inaccurate predictions(it will give mostly positive results).</p>
        </div>

        Another thing we can explore is, how this trend differs amongst categories. 
        If we are able to find any difference, we can maybe make use of it, when interpreting the performance of a model.

        <iframe src="./bar_interactive.html" class="w-2/3 m-auto" style="height: 500px;"></iframe>

        <p class="w-2/3 m-auto italic">As we can see, there doesn't seem to be a significant difference between rating distributions of different categories.
        From this we can conclude, that at least for major categories, the majority of reviews are positive, and the model,
        if not properly trained, will be biased towards positive ratings for books of all major categories, roughly equally.</p>

        <li class="font-semibold mt-5">The distribution of categories</li>

        <div class="flex flex-row">
          <p class="mt-5 w-2/3 content-center text-xl"> The following graphs illustrate, how imbalanced the categories are. 
            We can see, that the majority of categories have only a handfull of books, while . 
            Moreover, there is a stagering 10.8 thousand categories. 
            Meaning most of these represent a small niche or typos(which would be too costly to detect).
            Thus, when creating a model, I will have to keep in mind these facts, especially if I will choose to create a model with a content-based approach. </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold pt-10">Modelling</h2>
      <p>
        There are two main recommender types: explicit and implicit. Explicit models use rating data, whereas implicit - user interactions, such as purchase, clicks, listens, etc.
        With the data I have, I created an explicit recommender with two models.

        Given explicit data we can use three techniques: collaborative-filtering, content-based models and hybrid models.
        There are many trade-offs between these three and for a more .
        Here I have decided to create a switching hybrid model, that is composed of two algorithms:
        a traditional <b><a href="https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/matrix_factorization.html">SVD based collaborative filtering algorithm</a></b>
        and the <b><a></a></b> which will allow me to integrate the NLP data into the system.
